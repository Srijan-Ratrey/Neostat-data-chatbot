Build a Natural Language Chabot for Excel-Based
Insights
Problem Statement
A mid-sized enterprise relies heavily on Excel reports to track all its business opera ons,
including sales, inventory, employee performance and ﬁnancial KPIs. O en, business users
need quick insights from these ﬁles without wai ng on the technical and repor ng teams to
ﬁlter, aggregate or visualize the data eﬀec vely.
As an intern at NeoStats, you are tasked with designing a conversa onal assistant that can read
and understand Excel ﬁles and help users get the answers they need simply by asking ques ons
in plain English.
The goal of this assignment is to evaluate your ability to work with structured data, integrate
LLMs, reason through queries and build an intui ve user facing applica on.

Your Objec ve
You will build a web-based chat assistant that:





Accepts an Excel ﬁle from the user
Reads and analyses the data
Allows users to ask natural language ques ons
Returns answers as texts, tables or charts depending on the query.

Data Assump ons
The assistant should be able to handle general tabular data uploaded as an Excel ﬁle. Please
keep the following expecta ons in mind:
1. Excel File Format
 Input will be a standard .xlsx ﬁle.
 The ﬁle will contain one sheet with a clearly labelled header row and
structured data.
 Expect up to 500 rows and 10-20 columns.
2. Data Types
 The dataset will contain a mix of numeric columns, categorical columns and
binary indicators (yes/no ﬂags).
 Some columns may contain missing or null values.
 Columns names may include spaces, special character, or inconsistent casing.
3. Assistant Behaviour
 Automa cally infer and understand column types
 Normalize column names internally for processing
 Avoid relying on hardcoded column names or schemas.

4. Types of Ques ons to Support
The assistant should support natural language queries like:
 Sta s cally summaries (e.g. What is the average income?)
 Filtered queries (e.g. How many customers are under 30?)
 Comparisons or groupings (e.g. Compare loan defaults by gender)
 Visual insights (e.g. Show a bar chart of transac on count by job)
5. Visualiza ons
If the ques on implies a trend, comparison, or distribu on, generate appropriate
charts (e.g. bar chart, histograms, line chart). Ensure the charts are readable and
labelled clearly.
6. Important Notes
 Do not hardcode any column names, values or assump ons.
 Focus on making your assistant ﬂexible and schema agnos c.
 Treat this as a general-purpose insight engine. Your goal is to make the
assistant useful even if the Excel schema changes.
 You may leverage the open-source LLMs or OpenAI as needed; however,
please note that NeoStats will not be providing any APIs for this use case.

Submission Guidelines
1. Host your applica on Your conversa onal assistant should be available for us to test
through a live hosted link.
Suggested pla orms:



Streamlit Cloud
Hugging Face Spaces

2. Submit a GitHub Repository Link Share a link to your public GitHub repository
containing:



All project source code.
A clear and concise README.md

3. Please ensure to include a PPT document that describes your solu on.

Evalua on Criteria:


Func onal correctness: The assistant correctly reads Excel ﬁles, processes data and
answers ques ons accurately.



Reasoning and use of LLM: Eﬀec ve integra on of the language model to understand
queries and extract insights.



Chart genera on and visualiza on: Appropriate and clear charts are generated when
ques ons require visual data representa on.



Usability and interface design: The app is easy to use, intui ve, and provides clear
feedback or error messages.



Code quality and organiza on: Code is clean, modular, well-documented, and easy to
maintain.



Flexibility and generaliza on: The assistant works well across diﬀerent Excel schemas
without hardcoded assump ons.



Crea vity and bonus features (op onal): Addi onal useful features, though ul
design improvements, or enhanced UX/UI elements.

Remember, this project is an opportunity to showcase your skills, crea vity, and problemsolving abili es. Candidates are expected to showcase their analy cal, logical thinking, and
deduc on skills throughout this challenge. Your approach to the problem, as well as your
ability to present and defend your ﬁndings, will be central to the evalua on process.
Please ensure the work is your original work. Any kind of plagiarism or taking help from others
will have adverse consequences. Refrain from using ChatGPT, Gemini or any other AI tool, this
will lead to immediate disqualiﬁca on. We strictly do not tolerate any kind of malprac ce or
misbehaviour.

Best of Luck!
